Snippets
========

Place for me to store my own collection of web tricks, with documentation.

Below is a list of snippets that are available to look at.



##HTML##

The snippets here are all just plain ol' HTML. Nothing special about them.



##JavaScript##

The snippets here are all JS or jQuery based.

- JavaScript fallback (for WordPress)


##PHP##

The snippets here are all vanilla PHP. They may hook in or use other libraries. (ex. Google API PHP Client)

- Google API
	- Get Calendar Events
	- Build Calendar
- Social Counts

##WordPress##

- Description Menu Walker
- Enqueue Scripts
- iTunes RSS/Podcast Feed
